OCCURRENCES
===========

Occurrences need a start time and an end time. Options when creating
an occurrence:

  - MOMENT ("I just biked")
    Start time and end time are both the current time or a user-
    configurable time.

  - DURATION ("I biked for two hours")
    The user selects a duration, with the end time being the current
    time or a user-configurable time.

  - ONGOING ("I'm biking")
    This creates an occurrence with a start time but no end time. The
    user can stop ongoing occurrences manually.



EVENTS
======

What is the best way to name and display events?

  - Past tense ("Went to bed")
  - Present tense ("Going to bed")
  - Command ("Go to bed")

Maybe objects and actions should be separate?

  - Sleep: start, stop
  - Work: start, stop
  - Beer: acquire, consume
  - Food: acquire, consume
  - Game: acquire, start, stop
  - Toilet: start, stop

I think this way would be too complicated.



IDEAS
=====

The page background starts out dark and gets lighter as you go
through the occurrence creation process. Levels:

  - Multiple events
  - Single event
  - Multiple occurrences
  - Single occurrence

A page listing the most recent events could be neat. It could say "39
minutes ago, I walked Dansy."



PROFILES
========

I should be able to create an account and set events to public or
private. I might like to have a public record of some events.
